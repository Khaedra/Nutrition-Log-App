# Daily Nutrition Tracker
## For Gourmands, Epicures, and Computer Science Students

This application is designed to help keep track of what foods and macronutrients a user consumes everyday. Users will be able to set targets or keep a journal log to record meals and review progress. Options to set calorie or water goals are available, and recommended values of nutrients based on age and weight are also available. 

This is especially of interest to **students** since studies often don't allow sufficient time to prepare healthy meals and are easily forgettable in the face of deadlines and exams. Spending 5 minutes a day logging food may drastically help a student fix or change their eating habits and overall wellbeing. 

This friendly interface will also allow you to log multiple days and view weeks worth of progress. Handy for people who forget or want a reminder of past meals.
