# Job Application Organizer

## For Struggling Individuals (like myself)


This application is designed to aid students and aspiring professionals efficiently manage their numerous job applications. In today's job market, finding even the most mundane positions demands patience and persistence on harrowing platforms like linkedIn and Indeed. Feeling overwhelmed in the face of multiple deadlines and interview dates is almost a guarantee. With this app, you will be able to track the jobs you've applied for, deadlines, interviews, requirements, and more. You will have the option to assign your applications with a tag to signify importance or urgency. As well, interview and resume tips will also be available. 

This is especially of interest to me since second year co-op opportunities are approaching. While I don't have much experience on my resume, applying to as many jobs as possible is a good start. Keeping track of everything with a spreadsheet is both time consuming and unpleasant visually. Therefore, this app will be used to help myself and others in a similar position.
